They are pretty content with their lives among humans, so when they hear that the Antichrist is about to be born, they realize that the coming war between Heaven and Hell means they will have to leave Earth. They decide to team up to stop this from happening--however they can. This does not sound like it would add up to a funny book, but it really does!
